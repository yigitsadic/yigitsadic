Hello, this is Yigit 🖖

I’m a backend developer who’s always looking to learn and improve.

With TypeScript I’m used to utilize and learn Golang, Ruby, Rail, Docker and Nodejs, and others like gRPC. When it comes to my personality, I am interested, open to learning new things about the tools and technology I use and willing to explore.

Playing with React and GraphQL helps me relax and unwind.

I would like to know more about Golang, Docker & Kubernetes. 🤔
